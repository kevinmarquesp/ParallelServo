 *
 * This library is used to handle multiple servo components simultaneously
 * using the strategy of counting the output of the `millis()` function from
 * the `Arduino.h` library. For more information about this strategy, check out
 * the articles below:
 *   -> https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-1/using-millis-for-timing
 *   -> https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-multitasking-using-millis-in-arduino
 *   -> https://kevinmarquesp.github.io/post/230719143253_multitasking-com-um-arduino-uno/
 *
 * When a servo movement is done, it will count up the internal state
 * (represented by the _index property on this class) by one, starting with 0.
 * Which means that the servo will start with 0, when it is done, the index
 * should be 1, and if there is a movement that verifies if the index is 1 to
 * move, it will move, and the index will be 2 after that, and so on.
 *
 * In order to make this library work properly, you'll need to have the
 * `Servo.h` library installed. You can download it manually from this
 * repository:
 *   -> https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Servo
